## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
  Arrays in JavaScript are the data type used to store a list of values.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
  Opening and closing brackets: Array literals are enclosed in square brackets ([]), indicating the beginning and end of the array.

Elements: Inside the brackets, you can specify the elements of the array, separated by commas. An element can be any valid JavaScript expression, such as a value, variable, object, or even another array.
For example:
let myArray = [element1, element2, element3];

- What number represents the **first** index of an array?
  the first index of an array is represented by the number 0 (zero). This means that the element at the beginning of an array is accessed using the index 0.
- How can you access the last element of an array?
  To access the last element of an array in JavaScript, you can use the index notation combined with the length property of the array.
