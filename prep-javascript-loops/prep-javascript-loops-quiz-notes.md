## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

The condition expression in for and while loops determines whether the loop continues executing or terminates. It controls the repetition based on a true or false evaluation.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

The initialization expression in a for loop is evaluated once before the loop starts executing.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

The condition expression in a for loop is evaluated before each iteration to determine whether the loop should continue executing or terminate.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

The final expression in a for loop is evaluated at the end of each iteration, allowing you to update variables or perform other operations before the next iteration.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?

The purpose of the final expression in a for loop is to perform operations or updates at the end of each iteration before proceeding to the next iteration or terminating the loop.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?

The for...in loop is used with objects to iterate over their properties and with arrays to iterate over their elements.
